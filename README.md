# Spectral Measurements

My camera spectral measurement repo with data and source code.

## Measured cameras

Cameras measured so far:

- Canon 5D Mark III (x2)
- Sony A7
- Lumix GH1
- Lumix GF3
- Pentax * IST DL

I have measured a few more cameras including a Canon 5DS with a bad/old version of this setup.

I'm always looking for more cameras. Anyone in the UK willing to send me theirs for measurement?

## How it works

1. Full spectrum light passes through a monochromator, which narrows it down to one wavelength at a time
2. For violet and red wavelengths the light is additionally filtered before entering the monochromator
3. The monochromatic light of unknown intensity enters an integrating sphere which splits the light in to two identical outputs, and gets measured by:
    - photodiode (known response)
    - camera (unknown response)
4. Readings from the photodiode and camera files are processed to calculate the camera's spectral response

The monochromator has a significant zero error, so it is always positioned at a known wavelength (632.8nm) using a Helium Neon laser *before taking any measurements.*

## The setup

In action!!!11!!1 (not really, the 12V and 5V cables aren't even plugged in)

## History

This spectral measurement rig started as a lockdown project (March 2020 era). Slowly been finding and upgrading components using ebay, I'm almost satisfied with the setup now.

## Upgrade ideas

Not cheap ðŸ˜•

- Replace the TSL235 with a NIST traceable calibrated photodiode from Thorlabs
- Upgrade the lens from industar 61L/Z to something more neutral, maybe a Zeiss T*
