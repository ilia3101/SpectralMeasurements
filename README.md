# SpectralMeasurements

This spectral measurement rig started as a lockdown project (March 2020 era). Slowly been finding and upgrading components using ebay, and I'm almost satisfied with the setup now. The monochromator is good (190-920nm range), the integrating sphere is pretty good (started off with a DIY styrofoam ball). It's a beautiful mess of wires, foil and tape:

I am considering upgrading the photodiode to a NIST tracable calibrated unit from Thorlabs (and then applying corrections to all previous results made with the current TSL235), but that would be expensive so I don't know when.

I might also swap out the lens from an industar 61L/Z to something more neutral, maybe a ZEISS T*, and again correct all previous measurements to match the new setup. And again, this is expensive, so I don't know when I'll do this.

The text output by serial is the photodiode measurements.

Not like anyone will build my exact setup anyway...

Will start uploading spectral data soon (but not original raw camera files, they're too huge)
