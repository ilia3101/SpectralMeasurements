# SpectralMeasurements

The code in Arduino folder runs my automated spectral measurement system
consisting of a monochromator, an intergrating sphere, a (bad TSL235) photodiode,
a couple of filters, three motors and a lamp.

I am considering upgrading the photodiode to a NIST tracable calibrated unit from Thorlabs (and then applying corrections to all previous results made with the current TSL235), but that would be expensive soooo I don't know.

I might also swap out the lens from an industar 61L/Z to something more neutral, maybe a ZEISS T*, and again correct all previous measurements to match the new setup. And again, this is expensive, so I don't know when I'll do this.

The text output by serial is the photodiode measurements.

Not like anyone will build my exact setup anyway...

Will start uploading spectral data soon (but not original raw camera files, they're too huge)
