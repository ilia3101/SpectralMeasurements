# SpectralMeasurements

The code in Arduino folder runs my automated spectral measurement system
consisting of a monochromator, an intergrating sphere, a (bad TSL235) photodiode,
a couple of filters, three motors and a lamp.

I am considering upgrading the photodiode to a NIST tracable calibrated unit from Thorlabs (and then applying corrections to all previous results made with the current TSL235), but that would be expensive soooo I don't know.

The text output by serial is the photodiode measurements.

Not like anyone will build my exact setup anyway...

Will start uploading spectral data soon (but not original raw camera files, they're too huge)
