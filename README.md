# SpectralMeasurements

The code in Arduino folder runs my automated spectral measurement system
consisting of a monochromator, an intergrating sphere, a couple of filters,
three motors and a lamp.

The text output by serial is the photodiode measurements.

Not like anyone will build my exact setup anyway...

Will upload spectral data soon.
